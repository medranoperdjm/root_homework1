![Pylint](https://github.com/vcu-chfauerbach/root_homework1/workflows/Pylint/badge.svg)

For your homework, fork this repository to your account. https://github.com/vcu-chfauerbach/root_homework1 (Links to an external site.)

Updated the 'README.md' file to change the URLs for the github actions:

https://github.com/vcu-chfauerbach/root_homework1/workflows/Pylint/badge.svg (Links to an external site.)

should become

https://github.com/medranoperdjm/root_homework1/workflows/Pylint/badge.svg (Links to an external site.)

Edit the file ./homework1/hw1.py to make the three github actions pass.

When they pass, and you see the updated badges in your repository, send me a link to the repository, like:

https://github.com/vcu-chfauerbach/root_homework1 (Links to an external site.)

but
